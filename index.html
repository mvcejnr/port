            <h2 id="about">About Mvce</h2>
            <p> Mvce, whose real name is David Omoarebun Iseghoede, hails from Edo State, 
                Nigeria, and has quickly emerged as a captivating singer and songwriter 
                in the Afrobeats scene. Growing up in a family deeply immersed in music‚Äîhis 
                older siblings ran a recording studio‚Äîhe was surrounded by the vibrant sounds 
                that shaped his early years. This environment ignited his passion for music, 
                leading him to take the stage as a singer in primary school and start penning 
                his own songs by the time he was just 13.
                In 2017, Mvce released his debut single, "Wanna Be," a track that introduced 
                him to a wider audience and set the tone for his artistic journey. The positive 
                reception of the song made it clear that he was an artist to watch. Since then, 
                Mvce has collaborated with a diverse range of musicians, most notably teaming 
                up with German producer DJ Rapture, along with STARBOY alumnus LAX. As he gears 
                up for the release of his first body of work in 2025, Mvce is eager to explore 
                new musical landscapes while staying true to his roots. </p>
